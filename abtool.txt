ab TOOL
•	   Apache Bench (ab) is a tool for benchmarking performance of  Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.
•	   Its a free, open source performance testing solution that comes with Apache server.
Use
•	It especially shows - how many requests per second your Apache installation is capable of serving.
•	It is used to judge overall performance of the server.
When to USE
•	When attempting to create a large change in Drupal core.
•	To provide benchmark results to ensure that  any change made doesn't negatively impact performance.
    Before applying any patch
•	ab -c1 -n500 http://www.myurl.com
 -c command specifies the number of concurrent requests 
  -n specifies the total number of page requests
  
Important things to note
    à   Request per second: 
•	 Number of request that are being served per second.
•	 Value should be as high as possible.
         
    à  Table for Connection time :
•	 The second (mean) and third ([+/-sd]) column of the last row (Total). 
•	 The mean or average tells us how long a page request took on average (in milliseconds). 
•	The standard deviation is a means to judge how accurate a particular test result is.
•	If the standard deviation is large, then this is an indicator that something wasn't working as it should, for example, the web server was under high load or there was a network lag.
NOTE :
-> Request per seconds should be high.
-> Deviation should be less
